This tool significantly simplified the management and configuration of platforms, allowing the team to adapt to changes more quickly and improving overall work efficiency. After successfully completing this project, I was transferred to the development of core platforms for implementing game processes and mechanics, where I worked on creating intuitive interfaces and complex game logics, significantly improving user experience and increasing user engagement.<br><br>After launching the company's main project for internal use, I was appointed as the lead developer. From this point on, I actively led the development process: decomposing and distributing tasks, conducting code reviews, and personally merging changes into the main branch. My role included not only technical leadership but also strategic planning, which allowed us to meet our goals on time. I was involved in recruiting new developers to the team and organizing effective interaction between teams, creating a cohesive and productive work environment.<br><br>Under my leadership, modules for managing financial operations and providing game content to clients were developed. These modules ensured a high degree of automation and security of financial transactions, increasing clients' trust in our platform. During the work process, I developed the project architecture, created a user dashboard, implemented project documentation, optimized platform performance, and introduced automated tests. I also organized regular team meetings and conducted training for new employees, facilitating their quick adaptation and skill improvement.",
